The return codes are as follows:
0 : Completed successfully
1 : Timed out
2 : Insufficient manpower to process all the work
3 : Forced to change configuration as some necessary variables were missing from configuration passed
4 : Fatal error within optimisation - initial estimate was returned instead.

The codes can be returned in any combination, i.e. 12 means that the code timed out AND there was insufficient manpower.
